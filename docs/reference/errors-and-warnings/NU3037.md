# NuGet Warning NU3037


### Issue

The signature has expired as the certificate used to sign the package has expired.


### Solution

If in require mode, only packages signed by a trusted signer will pass validation. So please request the package author to re-sign the package using the `nuget sign` command as described in [NuGet docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/create-packages/sign-a-package) using a valid Timestamp Authority signing certificate.Otherwise, just ignore the warning.
